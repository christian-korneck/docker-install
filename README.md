# about this fork

this is a quick hack of the Docker install script to work around the [broken](https://github.com/docker/for-linux/issues/955) installation on Fedora 32 via the following workarounds:
- install packages from Docker fc31 repo (as there's currently no fc32 repo)
- `firewalld` backend: `nftables` -> `iptables` (if installed)
- kernel cmdline: cgroups v1

Alternatives:
- [Fedora Magazine article](https://fedoramagazine.org/docker-and-fedora-32/) (slightly different - uses moby, stays with nftables)
- [Blogpost](https://poweruser.blog/how-to-install-docker-on-fedora-32-f2606c6934f1?source=collection_home---5------1-----------------------) (this setup manually)

How to use:

```
sudo curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/christian-korneck/docker-install/master/install.sh | sh
```

and reboot

# docker/docker-install
Home of the script that lives at `get.docker.com` and `test.docker.com`!

The purpose of the install script is for a convenience for quickly
installing the latest Docker-CE releases on the supported linux
distros. It is not recommended to depend on this script for deployment
to production systems. For more thorough instructions for installing
on the supported distros, see the [install
instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/).
